#Â Presentation 
This is a salt configuration to mainly configure linux workstation.
A choice of profile based on "type" grain like (work or home in this tree) 
'''python
grains:
  type: work
'''

A partition for extra filesystem for data (default /data) is needed in pillar/setting.sls.
In this file change 
data: data => to your partition (like home or what ever)
datadev: /dev/sda4 => to your partitionfor thie extra fs

To use the salt tree, choose a base dir for installing the salt tree.
Copy Salt dir to this dir (like /opt) and cp etc/minion.opt.conf as minion (you may change the path by changing path in this file)
Then run :
salt-call --local -c /opt/Salt/etc/   state.show_highstate to verify (no execution just show).
Of course salt-minion needs to be installed.
To run :
salt-call --local -c /opt/Salt/etc/   state.highstate

#Â Presentation 
This is a salt configuration to mainly configure linux workstation.
A choice of profile based on type grain like 
'''python
grains:
  type: work
'''

A partition for extra filesystem for data (default /data) is needed in pillar/setting.sls.
In this file change 
data: data => to your partition (like home or what ever)
datadev: /dev/sda4 => to your partitionfor thie extra fs

To use the salt tree :
copy Salt dir to /opt 
salt-call --local -c /opt/Salt/etc/   state.show_highstate to verify.
or just copy the /opt/Salt/etc/minion in /etc/salt/minion.d/minion
Of course salt-minion needs to be installed.
If everything is fine then run : 
`salt-call  state.highstate`

# Supported distro

#Â Presentation 
This is a salt configuration to mainly configure linux workstation.
A choice of profile based on type grain like 
'''python
grains:
  type: work
'''
Should be run locally after fresh install of minion 
Change as this to run local :
file_client: local
Change file_root and pillar_root with your mount point.
The main configuration file is in etc/minion.conf where you set type grains and salt/pillar root dir.
Then copy the file on /etc/salt/minion.d and run to check  
`salt-call  state.show_highstate`
or to execute 
`salt-call  state.highstate`
